# MapFiles
I gave a talk at the Embedded Online Conference 2021 called [Buried Treasure and Map Files](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/session/Buried_Treasure_and_Map_Files). I spoke about how map files can be used to aid in development and what to look for. 

The talk is not publicly available yet but here are the slides and other materials.
