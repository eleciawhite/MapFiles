# MapFiles
There are two variations on my talk about how to use memory map files for embedded systems development and debugging.

**Memory Maps and Other Buried Treasures** is a talk about heaps, stacks, and memory maps (but definitely not linker files). It was a keynote talk at Hackaday Remoticon 2021. The video is coming soon but here are the [slides](MemoryMapsAndOtherBuriedTreasure_slides_ewhite.pdf). 

**Buried Treasure and Map Files** was initially presented at [Embedded Online Conference 2021](https://www.embeddedonlineconference.com/session/Buried_Treasure_and_Map_Files). There is a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRXLUcbJIxY&ab_channel=EleciaWhite) and [slides](BuriedTreasureMapFiles_slides_ewhite.pdf) of that version.

Here are the other materials. 

 * [Memory Map Land Image](MemoryMapLand.jpg) or [at Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/m/QRENA5--memory-map-land/)
 * [Hello.map](hello.map) and [Hello.cmd linker file](hello.cmd) (TI processor)
 * [Map file for the BLE and Zigbee application](dmm_zc_switch_remote_display_oad_app_CC26X2R1_LAUNCHXL_tirtos_ccs.map) (TI processor)
 * [Map file for Circuit Python on the SEEDunio via GCC](circuit_python_seeduino_xaio_firmware.elf.map) and [linker file](circuit_python_seeduino_xaio_firmware_common.ld).
